# Project Notes

## Content

This file contains supporting notes for the academic project.

## Key observations:
    	•	Internal traffic is allowed by default in Azure subnets.
	    •	Subnet-level NSG rules override VM-level NSGs.
	    •	Blocking internal traffic prevents lateral movement.
	    •	Virtual network flow logs provide sufficient monitoring evidence.

## Limitations:
     	•	Small-scale environment with two virtual machines.
    	•	No automated alerting or response implemented.
